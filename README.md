# Zipoco Food ETL with Airflow Orchestration

This repository contains an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline project for Zipco Foods, orchestrated using Apache Airflow.

## Overview

The project is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for Zipco Foods, leveraging Airflow for workflow orchestration. The primary language used in this repository is Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to prototype and document the ETL steps.

## Features

- **End-to-End ETL Pipeline:** Extracts data from various sources, transforms it for analytics or reporting, and loads it into the desired destination.
- **Airflow Orchestration:** Utilizes Apache Airflow to schedule, monitor, and manage ETL workflows, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** Facilitates data exploration, visualization, and step-by-step documentation of the ETL logic.
