# Zipoco Food ETL with Airflow Orchestration

## Overview

The project is designed to handle data extraction, transformation, and loading processes for Zipco Foods, leveraging Airflow for workflow orchestration. The transformed data is stored in Azure Blob Storage, providing scalable and secure cloud storage.

## Features

- **End-to-End ETL Pipeline:** Extracts data from various sources, transforms it for analytics or reporting, and loads it into Azure Blob Storage.
- **Airflow Orchestration:** Utilizes Apache Airflow to schedule, monitor, and manage ETL workflows, ensuring reliability and scalability.
- **Azure Blob Storage Integration:** Stores the transformed data in Azure Blob Storage for further processing, analytics, or archival.
- **Jupyter Notebook Integration:** Facilitates data exploration, visualization, and step-by-step documentation of the ETL logic.

## Getting Started
